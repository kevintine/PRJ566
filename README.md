# PRJ666 Layout

Start the application with 
```
npm start
```

You'll need to install these libraries to run the app
```
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm install react-router-dom
npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap
```

We're using react-bootstrap for the CSS and styling so keep it consistant for your code. 

I didn't make a pretty layout but you guys can play around react-bootstrap and see what you like and maybe suggest a style for the group. 

If you have trouble with the code, look up some MERN stack tutorials for help or let me know.
