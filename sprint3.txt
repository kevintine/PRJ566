Use Case Real Time Updates

The bowling script sends frame requests to the backend add-frame-to-bowling-alley.

Now in that backend route, everytime it is hit, send a request to the react
frontend.
	- I'm using Server Side Events (SSE)
	- I'm currently implementing SSE. Just changed the /add-frames route, 
	  now I'm creating an SSE route. 

Ohhh, so when the frame is sent to the frontend, we need the player Id to go along with it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright so we got the data to display real time!!!

Now we need to integrate the old way display back. 
	- Display new colour table once all frames are filled. 
	- Update totals

Bowling display only works with quick start, get it to work with a logged in user.

Allow for Lane selection
